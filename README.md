# NoSQL Challenge: Eat Safe, Love

*NoSQL Challenge Assignment for Data Science Bootcamp, Module 12*

## Background
*The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.*

## Assignment Components
This repository consists of two main components:

* **Primary Jupyter Notebook (`NoSQL Setup Chapter.ipynb`):**
This notebook serves as a database setup tool used to import the provided JSON file into a MongoDB database. It also serves as our introduction to Regex. The command used to import the JSON file's information is included in this notebook. Libraries used include *Pymongo* and *Pretty Print*.

* **Secondary Jupyter Notebook (`NoSQL Analysis Chapter.ipynb`):**
This notebook serves as the analysis tool for the imported data. It includes the answers to the requested questions utilizing knowledge from our Regex lessons. Libraries used include *Pymongo*, *Pretty Print*, and *Pandas*.

## Files Included
- `NoSQL Setup Chapter.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for importing the JSON data and preparing for analysis.
- `NoSQL Analysis Chapter.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for analyzing the imported data and answering requested questions.
- `establishments.json`: JSON files provided to us for database setup and analysis (contained in *Resources* directory).

All notebooks were developed in a *Python* environment managed by *Anaconda*, with code written in *Visual Studio Code*.
